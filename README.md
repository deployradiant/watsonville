# Chevrolet of Watsonville chatbot

 Recently [someone discovered](https://stoney.monster/@stoneymonster/111592567052438463) that they could use the Chevrolet support bot to answer any questions, effectively turning it into a proxy for GPT-4.
 This is a demo of a chatbot built using the Radiant platform that protects against this kind of abuse.
